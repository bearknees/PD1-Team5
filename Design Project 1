Design of Optimized Evacuation Routing for a Digital Twin Geographical Mapping System

The general objective of this project is to design an optimized evacuation routing within a digital twin geographical mapping system that integrates near real-time hazard assessments and simulations to enhance disaster preparedness.

* Design a system that simulates the physical to digital environment for optimized evacuation routes.
* Develop a web application for hazard forecasting and evacuation route management.
* Develop a mobile application that notifies hazard assessments and displays the optimized evacuation routes of the user.
* Test and evaluate the accuracy.
